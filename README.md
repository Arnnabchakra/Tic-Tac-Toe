# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides a two-player experience, where players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a line of three consecutive symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
